# vue-bootstrap-sidebar

`vue-bootstrap-sidebar` is a Vue sidebar menu component build using [`bootstrap-vue`](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) components. 
> **Note:** *This is very first version. It will need more effort to have it ready for production (tests, lint, etc.). You can find very nice and more mature alternative [here](https://github.com/yaminncco/vue-sidebar-menu).*
